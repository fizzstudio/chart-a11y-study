      <h1>Fizz Studio: Assessing Chart Accessibility</h1>
      <p>
        This test environment is intended to be used to help evaluate access barriers in online, interactive
        charts and graphs. We are evaluating a series of interactive charts and graphs with various assistive
        technologies and native users.
      </p>
      <p>
        These environments are set up so that participants can help us evaluate the usability of these charts and
        graphs. They are not intended to test the individual abilities of our participants.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following section is where our test chart will render. These tests may be changed by choosing an option in
        the previous Environments nav menu.
      </p>
      <p>When we are ready to begin evaluating, please select First Chart in the previous Environments menu. Then read the tasks, familiarize yourself with the chart, and perform the tasks.</p>

The histogram below shows the heights (in centimeters ) distribution of 30 people.
a) How many people have heights between 159.5 and 169.5 cm?
b) How many people have heights less than 159.5 cm?
c) How many people have heights more than 169.5 cm?
d) What percentage of people have heights between 149.5 and 179.5 cm?

a) 7 people
b) 9 + 6 = 15 people
c) 5 + 2 + 1 = 8 people
d) (9 + 7 + 5)/30 = 0.7 = 70%  

TODO: let users select multiple data points and get statistical details, like total numbers
- then let them store those results and compare them against another set of selections
